        <h1>Happy Birthday, Samra! üíñ</h1>
        <p>
            My dearest Samra,<br><br>
            From the moment we met six months ago, you've been one of the best parts of my life. 
            Your presence alone makes everything feel lighter, easier, and a lot more beautiful. 
            The way you carry yourself, your kindness, your energy‚Äîit's something rare, and I feel lucky to know you.<br><br>
            And those <span class="highlight">pretty eyes</span> of yours? They hold a kind of magic, 
            a depth that makes the world pause for a second. I don‚Äôt know if you realize it, 
            but you have this way of making people feel special, of making every moment with you unforgettable.<br><br>
            On your special day, I just want you to know that you are truly one of a kind. 
            You deserve all the happiness, love, and success in the world, and I hope this year brings you closer 
            to everything your heart desires.<br><br>
            Keep being the amazing person you are, and never stop shining the way you do.  
            Enjoy your day to the fullest‚Äîyou deserve it all! ‚ù§<br><br>
            With all the admiration,<br>
            <strong>Daniyal</strong>
